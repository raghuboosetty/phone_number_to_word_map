Given a 10 digit phone number, you must return all possible words or combination of words from the provided dictionary, that can be mapped back as a whole to the number.

With this we can generate numbers like 1-800-motortruck which is easier to remember then 1-800-6686787825
The phone number mapping to letters is as follows:

2 = a b c
3 = d e f
4 = g h i
5 = j k l
6 = m n o
7 = p q r s
8 = t u v
9 = w x y z
 
The phone numbers will never contain a 0 or 1. 
Words have to be at least 3 characters.

To get give you an initial verification, the following must be true:

6686787825 should return the following list [["motor", "usual"], ["noun", "struck"], ["nouns", "truck"], ["nouns", "usual"], ["onto", "struck"], "motortruck"]
2282668687 should return the following list [["act", "amounts"], ["act", "contour"], ["acta", "mounts"], ["bat", "amounts"], ["bat", "contour"], ["cat", "contour"], "catamounts"]

The conversion of a 10 digit phone number should be performed within 1000ms.

Please create a public github repo for this project under your own account and commit at least once per hour to the repo. Doing this will allow us to see the steps you took to come to the solution.
The complete solution should include unit tests that at a minimum should include the two provided examples.
You solution should contain one method that we can call with a 10 digit number. We will use this method to test a set of random numbers and verify the output.
You have 8 hours to complete this assignment in Ruby.
